Welcome!

I am a graduate student in the physics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying plasma physics with a focus on astrophysical phenomena in the lab. I specialize in passive optical diagnostics for low-temperature plamas. I became interested in data science and machine learning when I needed to use Bayesian techniques to leverage data from different plasma diagnostics to reduce measurement uncertainty. 

On this website, you can find information regarding my research and side projects.
