excerpt: 'We have developed a low-cost spectrometer with simple optical design that achieves unprecedented precision measurements of ion temperature (±0.01 eV) and velocity (±20 m/s). A Fabry-Pérot étalon provides the simultaneous high resolving power and high throughput needed for the light levels available in singly ionized helium and argon plasmas. Reducing the systematic uncertainty in the absolute wavelength calibration needed for the specified velocity precision motivates a Bayesian analysis method called Nested Sampling to address the nontrivial uncertainty in the diffraction order. An initial emission measurement of a singly charged stationary argon plasma yields a temperature of 0.339 ± 0.007 eV and a velocity of −3 ± 4 m/s with a systematic uncertainty of 20 m/s.'
